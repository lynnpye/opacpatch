This is a very, very tiny mixin that works with the [Open Parties and Claims](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-parties-and-claims) mod to also protect players from entity attack while in their claim.

It alters the functionality of xaero.pac.common.server.claims.protection.ChunkProtection.isProtectable(Entity) to, instead of excluding Players, explicitly includes Players.

Only required for single player, LAN host, and dedicated server environments. Just drop it into the mods folder; there is no configuration.

If you have a problem, remove this mod. If you think there is a problem with OPAC, still remove this mod instead. The OPAC author should *not* be held responsible for any issues caused by this mod.

I don't plan to put this onto CurseForge. If you grab this and install it, I will assume you know what you are doing.
